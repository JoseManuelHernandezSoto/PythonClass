Say hey!
Cha!
Hear the sound of the falling rain
Coming down like an Armageddon flame (hey!)
The shame, the ones who died without a name
Hear the dogs howling out of key
To a hymn called "Faith and Misery" (hey!)
And bleed, the company lost the war today, and
Oh I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives (whoa, oh, whoa, oh)
On holiday!
Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protester has crossed the line (hey!)
To find the money's on the other side
Can I get another amen? (Amen!)
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (hey!)
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument
Oh I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives (whoa, oh, whoa, oh)
On holiday!
Hey!
Three, four!
The representative from California has the floor
"Sieg Heil" to the president Gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel towers
Who criticize your government
"Bang! Bang!" goes the broken glass, and
Kill all the fags that don't agree
Try to fight fire, setting fire
Is not a way that's meant for me
Just 'cause (hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Just 'cause, because we're outlaws, yeah (hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Oh I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives (whoa, oh, whoa, oh)
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives (whoa, oh, whoa, oh)
This is our lives on holiday!"""
